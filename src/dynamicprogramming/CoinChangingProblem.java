     * Given coin denominations and the total amount, find out the numberâ€‹ of ways to make the change.
     * Denominations: 1, 2, 5
     * Amount: 7
     * Total Methods: 6
     *
     * Runtime Complexity:
     * O(m n) where m is number of denominations and n is amount.
     *
     * Memory Complexity:
     * Linear, O(n) where n is the amount.
     *
     * Dynamic programming is a problem solving approach which is used when naive approach results in
     * exponential time complexity. To apply dynamic programming approach, the problem to be solved must
     * have optimal substructure i.e. optimal solution of the problem at hand could be achieved by
     * leveraging the optimal solutions of its subproblems and overlapping sub-problems i.e. using
     * pre-computed values for solved sub-problems so that we don't have to solve them again.
     * The coin changing problem has both optimal substructure i.e it can be easily divided to simpler
     * problems and they can be solved to find final solution and it also satisfies the property of
     * overlapping sub problems i.e. previously solved sub problem results can be used multiple times.
